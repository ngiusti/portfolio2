      "Friends for over a decade, I argue that I know Nick better than most. As a software developer myself, I am acutely aware of what the wrong personality can do to a team. Nick possess the required personality traits of a software developer in abundance. Willing to compromise, as eager to teach as he is to learn, an emotionally aware communicator, an ego that fits comfortably within his head and the right balance of professionalism and humor that staves off burnout. Nick has forever been the cohesive force behind the best groups of friends I've had and still have.",
